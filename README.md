## Content
The IPM works in MatLab software. This repository includes the source code and computational results for all randomly generated numerical instances presented in the paper.
### Code files 
The code folders include **CoASLTP**, **CoPathsolver** and **Bargaining**.
1. The code in the folder **CoASLTP** is for comparing the proposed interior-point difierentiable path-following method (**IPM**) and the **ASLTP**, where the file [ycsgse.m](CoASLTP/ycsgse.m) is the main program of the **IPM** and [dltpsgse.m](CoASLTP/dltpsgse.m) is the main program of the **ASLTP**. The code in this folder has been used in Section 4.1.
2. The code in the folder **CoPathsolver** is for comparing the proposed **IPM** and the **path solver**, where the file [trysg.m](CoPathsolver/trysg.m) is the main program. The code in this folder has been used in Sections 4.2 and 4.3.
3. The folder **Bargaining** includes the code for computing a solution to the bargaining model, which has been presented in Section 4.4.
### Results files
The results folders **comp-ASLTP**, **comp-pathsolver** and **morecomplicated** record the computational results for all numerical examples used in the paper.
1. The files [A0.txt](comp-ASLTP/A0.txt), [A1.txt](comp-ASLTP/A1.txt), [A2.txt](comp-ASLTP/A2.txt), [A3.txt](comp-ASLTP/A3.txt) in the folder **comp-ASLTP** consist of the computational time and number of iterations of **IPM** and **ASLTP** for solving various stochastic games. We summarize these comparison results in the file [comp-sltp.xlsx](comp-ASLTP/comp-sltp.xlsx). The average computational time has been reported in Table 1 of the manuscript. 
2. The file [comp-path.txt](comp-pathsolver/comp-path.txt) in the folder **comp-pathsolver** includes the comparison results between the proposed **IPM** and the **path solver**. We summarize these results in an excel sheet named [comp-path.xlsx](comp-pathsolver/comp-path.xlsx), which is exactly Table 2 in the manuscript. Additionally, the file [test-success-rate.txt](comp-pathsolver/test-success-rate.txt) consists of the results of the path solver for stochastic games with different scales and the success rate among 100 randomly generated examples for each case.
3. The files [rdata0.txt](morecomplicated/rdata0.txt),...,[rdata11.txt](morecomplicated/rdata11.txt) in the folder **morecomplicated** record the computational time of **IPM** for all large-scale stochastic games. We summarize these instance results in [more-complicated.xlsx](morecomplicated/more-complicated.xlsx). The average computation time for each case has been reported in Table 3 of the paper.

We finally illustrate how to implement the code and associate the code files with the numerical results (e.g., tables and figures) presented in the paper.
1. By running the files [exm1.m](CoASLTP/exm1.m), [exm2.m](CoASLTP/exm2.m), [exm3.m](CoASLTP/exm3.m),  [exm4.m](CoASLTP/exm4.m), [exm5.m](CoASLTP/exm5.m) in the folder **CoASLTP**, one can obtain the computational results for the five fundamental examples in Section 4.1.
5. By running the file [inputs225.m](CoASLTP/inputs225.m) in the folder **CoASLTP**, one can get a stationary equilibrium for a stochastic game with two players, two states and five actions for each player in each state. The computational costs of the **IPM** and **ASLTP** for solving this instance are obtained as well. By repeatedly running [inputs225.m](CoASLTP/inputs225.m) for ten times, one can obtain the average computational time for both methods, which is shown in the first row of Table 1. Through changing the parameters *n*; *d*; *m*; *pd0* in [inputs225.m](CoASLTP/inputs225.m), we can attain various instances. The average computational time of IPM for solving these stochastic games are shown in Table 1 and Table 3.
6. By implementing the file  [se225.m](CoPathsolver/se225.m) in the folder **CoPathsolver**, one can get the comparison results between the proposed **IPM** and the **path solver** for computing a stationary equilibrium in a randomly generated stochastic game with two players, two states and five actions. Similarly, by changing the parameters *n*; *d*;*m*, we attain various stochastic games with difierent scales. The comparison results are included in Table 2. By running the file [r1.m](CoPathsolver/r1.m), one may obtain the success rates of the two methods for 100 randomly generated stochastic games, which are recorded in Figure 5.
7. By implementing the file [bargaining.m](Bargaining/bargaining.m) in the folder **Bargaining**, one can get Figure 6, which shows a solution to the presented bargaining model.
